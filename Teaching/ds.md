# Programming for Data Science

> Instructor and Teaching Assistant - University of Rhode Island

I led the Data Science course for a class of 30 students, helping them build a deep understanding of data science followed by introducing them to ML models. We explored topics like what is data science, basics of machine learning, ethics, ML models - KNN, LR etc, unsupervised learning, NLP etc. 

I also graded the assignments and assisted students in-person by organizing office hours.
