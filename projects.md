My work spans research (qualitative and quantitative), research paper writing, problem solving, analysis and coding. Each project reflects a balance between curiosity-driven research, and a drive for practical problem solving.

Below are the projects that showcase my experience. Each project page gives a brief look at its goals, methods, and outcomes.
