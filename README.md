## Hi there 👋

You have reached my GitHub page somehow. You're in for a ride 😄  
To look at my work in a nicer format, check out [my portfolio](https://github.com/surbhir08/surbhir08.github.io)!

* My name is Surbhi Rathore  
* PhD in Computer and Statistical Science from University of Rhode Island (May 2026)  
* Graduate Research Assistant (current) and Teaching Assitant at the University of Rhode Island  
* Current Project and Research:
   * Fair intervention evaluation 
     * simulated datasets that embed statistical biases, allowing practitioners to see how discrimination can propagate through algorithms. By showing these effects in a controlled way, my work guides practitioners in choosing fairness interventions that are most effective at mitigating harm.  
   * FairAgentBench
     * developed a benchmarking framework for evaluating large language model agents in the context of fairness and reliability
* Previous projects:
  * Task fair framework (TFF):
    * Created a quantitative fairness framework based on mutual information to check data bias and could be used in early data preprocessing and model development pipeline.
  * Fair feature selection techniques
  * Human centered study on TFF

* Teaching:
  * Held office hours and working sessions for Data Science class (CSC 310) for four semesters and also took class as an instructor for one semester. 
  * Ran two labs of 30 students each for Database Management systems class for one semesters  
  * Graded and ran lab sessions for software engineering course (CSC 305)
